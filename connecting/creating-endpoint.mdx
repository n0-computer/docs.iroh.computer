title: "Creating an Endpoint"
---

An endpoint is the core building block of an iroh node. It manages network
connections, handles incoming and outgoing traffic, and provides the necessary
infrastructure for implementing protocols.

Once you have an Endpoint, you can use it to create connections or accept
incoming connections from other endpoints. 

## Creating an Endpoint

This method initializes a new endpoint and binds it to a local address, allowing it
to listen for incoming connections.

```rust
use iroh::Endpoint;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let endpoint = Endpoint::bind().await?;
    // ...
}
```


1. `bind` creates the endpoint and starts listening for
incoming connections
2. `await` keyword is used to wait for the endpoint
to be created in an asynchronous context.

## Next Steps

With an endpoint created, you can now start discovering and connecting to other endpoints.
