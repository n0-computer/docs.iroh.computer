Some features on your Iroh Services project require authorization.

Examples of what **doesn't** require authorization:
- Synchronizing data across relays 
- [Holepunching](/concepts/holepunching) connections to other iroh endpoints

Examples of what **does** require authorization:
- Uploading metrics from endpoints to your project
- Creating custom metrics

# API Keys

The Iroh Services platform adds access control on top of iroh's permissionless system to control who
can & cannot make use of resources backed by cloud infrastructure.

Access control in Iroh Services aims to be as minimal as possible, leaving room for your
app to have its own opinion of how access control should work within your app.

Connections over iroh are end-to-end encrypted, using ED25519 keypairs on either
end of the connection. Iroh Services re-uses ED keys for SSH-style access.

To authorize endpoints to push metrics to your project, Iroh Services uses API Keys.

## Creating an API Key

1. Go to your project dashboard
2. Click on the "API Keys" tab
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Give your API Key a name
5. Click "Create"

```rust
use iroh::Endpoint;
use iroh_n0des::Client;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    let endpoint = Endpoint::builder().bind().await?;
    endpoint.online().await;
    
    // Use your API key to authenticate
    let client = Client::new(&endpoint, "YOUR_API_KEY").await?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

See the [quickstart](/iroh-services/quickstart) for a full example of using the Iroh Services client.

## Permissions

Right now, API Keys only control access to pushing metrics to your project.
In the future, API Keys may be used to control access to other resources
within your project. If you are interested in permissions or time-based access
control, please [contact us](https://n0.computer/contact).
