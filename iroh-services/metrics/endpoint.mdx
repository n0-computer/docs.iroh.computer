description: "Detailed metrics at the endpoint level for Pro and Enterprise plans"

On the pro and enterprise plan, you can get more detailed
metrics at the endpoint level. These metrics give you visibility into the behavior
of individual endpoints in your network. This can help you identify performance issues
or bottlenecks that may be affecting specific endpoints.

Some of the key endpoint-level metrics include:

- **Request Latency**: The time taken to process requests at the endpoint.
- **Error Rates**: The frequency of errors occurring at the endpoint.
- **Throughput**: The amount of data processed by the endpoint over time.
- **Connection Counts**: The number of active direct connections to the endpoint.

In the Iroh Services dashboard, you can view these metrics for each endpoint added to
your project. Drilling down into a specific endpoint can be a powerful tool to 
identify and resolve issues quickly.

By monitoring endpoint-level metrics, you can ensure that each node in your
network is performing optimally, leading to a better overall experience for your users.

## Retention and Lookback

Projects on the Pro or Enterprise plans have access to
extended retention and lookback for endpoint-level metrics. This allows you to
analyze historical data and identify trends over time, which can be crucial for
long-term performance optimization and troubleshooting.

Please refer to the pricing page for more details on plan features
and benefits. [Contact us](mailto:contact@n0.computer) if you have any questions about upgrading your plan.
