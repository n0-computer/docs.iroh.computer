### Shipping quality software is hard.

Much worse if you need to connect devices directly. You’ll have to hire at least one distributed systems engineer, they’ll pull & configure a library for you, throw a dart at a pile of whitepapers, and hope they’ve chosen the right techniques. If you’re lucky the first version will land after 6 months of work. When it finally does ship, the bug reports start.

“doesn’t work on hotel wifi”, “laggy”, “my phone is hot”. Users say kind things in interviews, but things are not clicking. Your networking engineer is now a networking team, the project is 8 months behind schedule, three quarters of your innovation budget is spent, and your vision of building something with real user benefits is starting to slip.

It doesn’t have to be this way. The [n0.computer](https://n0.computer) team can get you out of the food, water, & shelter phase. We can get you up & running in weeks, with the tools to scale, so you can focus on delivering meaningful software.
