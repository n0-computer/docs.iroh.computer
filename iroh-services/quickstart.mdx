This guide will walk you through setting up your first Iroh Services-enabled application.

## Prerequisites

- [An Iroh Services Account](https://n0des.iroh.computer)
- [Rust Language](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/) 

*While iroh is currently only available in Rust, it can be deployed in many other languages and environments.
Please refer to our [Using Iroh Services with Other
Languages](deployment/other-languages) guide for more information.*

## Step 1: Create a Project

After signing in, [create a new project](https://n0des.iroh.computer/projects/projects/new). This will be your
sandbox for all endpoints. This is the control center where you can manage and
monitor your infrastructure, including relays, metrics, and networks.

## Step 2: Get Your API Key

Navigate to your project's API Keys tab and create a new API key. You'll need
this to authenticate your endpoints.

## Step 3: Add the Iroh Services Client

Add the `iroh-n0des` crate to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
iroh = "0.35"
iroh-n0des = "0.1"
```

## Step 4: Connect Your Endpoint

```rust
use iroh::Endpoint;
use iroh_n0des::Client;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    // Create an iroh endpoint
    let endpoint = Endpoint::builder().bind().await?;
    
    // Wait for the endpoint to be online
    endpoint.online().await;
    
    // Create the Iroh Services client with your API key
    let client = Client::new(&endpoint, "YOUR_API_KEY").await?;
    
    // Your endpoint is now reporting metrics to Iroh Services!
    
    Ok(())
}
```

- [Metrics](/iroh-services/metrics): Understand the metrics collected by Iroh Services
- [Relays](/iroh-services/relays): Set up dedicated relay servers for your network
