# Relays

##### Relays route encrypted traffic unless a direct, P2P connection is feasible. This approach allows devices to maintain secure, low-latency connection, even in challenging network situations.

Devices running iroh will attempt to connect to each other directly either on the
local area network (LAN), or over the internet using NAT traversal techniques like
hole punching.  

However, in some situations direct connections are not possible. This can be due to
strict NATs, firewalls, or other network configurations that prevent direct peer-to-peer
connections. 

In these cases, relays provide a reliable fallback mechanism to ensure
connectivity between devices by forwarding traffic between them over the relay
server. This traffic is end-to-end encrypted, so the relay server cannot read
the contents of the communication.

Relays help in the following ways:
- **NAT Traversal**: Many devices are behind Network Address Translators (NATs) or firewalls that prevent direct connections. Relays help bypass these restrictions by acting as a middleman.
- **Connection Stability**: Relays can provide a stable connection point, especially in cases where direct connections are unreliable.
- **Global Reach**: By using relays located in various geographic locations, devices can connect more efficiently, reducing latency and improving uptime.  

For more information on relays, please refer to the [Relay concepts documentation](/concepts/relays).

## Hosted Relays

By default, iroh endpoints will use public relays to facilitate connections when direct
peer-to-peer connections are not possible. These relays are managed and
maintained by the [n0.computer](https://n0.computer), and are shared by a global public network of
developers, with rate limits.

However, for production use cases you will want to set up your own private relays, to
ensure that your traffic is not mixed with other users, and to have more control
over the relay infrastructure.

You can do this in one of three ways:

1. **[Public Cloud Relays](/iroh-services/relays/public)**: By default, all iroh nodes will connect to the public cloud relays. These relays have no guaranteed uptime and can be subject to noisy neighbors.
2. **[Dedicated Relays](/iroh-services/relays/managed)**: You can have relays run by the [n0.computer](https://n0.computer) , by adding them to your project through the Iroh Services platform. This is the easiest way to get started with relays.
3. **[Self-hosted](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/tree/main/iroh-relay)**: You can set up and manage your own relay servers using the iroh relay software. This gives you full control over the relay infrastructure, but requires more effort to set up and maintain.
