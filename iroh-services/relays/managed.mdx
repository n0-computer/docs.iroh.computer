title: "Managed Relays"
description: "Dedicated relay infrastructure managed by n0.computer"
---

By default, iroh endpoints will use publically-hosted relays to facilitate connections when direct
peer-to-peer connections are not possible. These relays are managed and
maintained by [n0.computer](https://n0.computer). 

For production, you will need to deploy your own hosted relay. you can do that through the [Iroh Services](https://n0des.iroh.computer)
platform, and then add it to your rust client endpoint configuration.

## Key Benefits

- **Fully Managed Service**: Number 0's engineering experts handle all day-to-day operations and infrastructure maintenance.
- **Isolation**: Maintain full control over your cloud infrastructure and scaling properties, with no noisy neighbors.
- **Version locking**: Ensure compatibility by locking to specific iroh versions or enable blue/green deployments.
- **Multi-Region & Multi-Cloud Support**: Enhance reliability and performance by deploying relays across various regions and cloud providers.
- **On-prem**: Deploy relays within your own data centers or private clouds for enhanced security and compliance. Please [contact us](mailto:hello@n0.computer) for more information.
- **Custom SLAs**: Tailor service level agreements to meet your specific business needs. Please [contact us](mailto:hello@n0.computer) for more information.

## Configuration

```rust
use iroh::Endpoint;
use iroh::relay::RelayUrl;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    // Configure your endpoint with dedicated relays
    let relay_url1: RelayUrl = "RELAY_URL_1".parse()?;
    let relay_url2: RelayUrl = "RELAY_URL_2".parse()?;
    
    let endpoint = Endpoint::builder()
        .relay_mode(iroh::endpoint::RelayMode::Custom(vec![relay_url1, relay_url2]))
        .bind()
        .await?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

## Recommended Relay Setup

For production use cases, we recommend setting up at least two relays in
different geographic regions. This ensures that if one relay goes down or
becomes unreachable, your endpoints can still connect through the other relay.

Each relay can handle up to 10,000 concurrent connections, so for larger scale
deployments, you may need to set up multiple relays in each region or [contact
us to increase the size of your relays](mailto:hello@n0.computer).

## Support policy

As part of your project-level and relay-level metrics, you will be able to
monitor status of your relays. On the pro plan, we offer priority support.
