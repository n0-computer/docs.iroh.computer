description: "Free shared relays for development and hobby use"

By default, all endpoints will use public shared relays to facilitate connections, both forwarding traffic when direct
peer-to-peer connections are not possible as well as facilitate holepunching for
direct connections. These relays are managed and maintained by [the n0 team](https://n0.computer),
and are shared by a global public network of developers.

## Support policy

The public relays will always be available for free and hobby plans, but are not
covered by any SLA or uptime guarantee.

The public relays will only officially support the latest stable release of
iroh. If older versions of iroh work with the public relay, this is a happy
accident, and not something to be relied upon for production use cases. 

There is no version locking. This means that iroh team reserves the right to remove
support for old versions of iroh from the public relay infrastructure at any
time.

For version locking, blue/green deployments, multi-region or multi-cloud
support, we recommend that you upgrade to a [managed
relay](/iroh-services/relays/managed).

## Privacy and Security

All traffic sent through the public relays is end-to-end encrypted. The relays
are not able to read any of the traffic that they forward or help connect.
However, the relays are able to see metadata about connections, such as source
and destination IP addresses, connection times, and the amount of data
transferred.

We recommend that you do not use the public relays for sensitive or
confidential data. If you need more control over your relay infrastructure, we
recommend that you upgrade to a [managed relay](/iroh-services/relays/managed) or
[self-host your own relay](https://iroh.computer).

We monitor the public relays for abuse and malicious activity. If we detect
abuse, we reserve the right to block offending IP addresses or users from
accessing the public relays.
