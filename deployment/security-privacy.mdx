iroh is designed with security and privacy as core principles. This document
outlines the key security and privacy features of iroh, as well as best
practices for deploying and using iroh in a secure manner.

## End-to-End Encryption

All data transmitted between iroh endpoints is protected with end-to-end
encryption. This means that data is encrypted on the sender's device and can only
be decrypted by the intended recipient. Even relay servers that facilitate
connections between endpoints cannot read the data being transmitted.

End-to-end encryption is achieved using modern cryptographic algorithms and protocols,
ensuring that data remains confidential and secure during transit. By defaul;t,
iroh uses Ed25519 keys for endpoint identities and encryption. If you require
different cryptographic algorithms, you can configure iroh to use them during
endpoint creation.

## Public Relays

All traffic sent through the public relays is end-to-end encrypted. The relays
are not able to read any of the traffic that they forward or help connect.
However, the relays are able to see metadata about connections, such as source
and destination IP addresses, connection times, and the amount of data
transferred.

We recommend that you do not use the public relays for sensitive or confidential
data. If you need more control over your relay infrastructure, we recommend that
you use [dedicated infrastructure](/deployment/dedicated-infrastructure) for production systems.

We monitor the public relays for abuse and malicious activity. If we detect
abuse, we reserve the right to block offending IP addresses or users from
accessing the public relays.

## IP Privacy and Peer-to-Peer Connections

Peer-to-peer networking with direct connections and hole-punching is fundamentally
incompatible with IP address privacy. When two endpoints establish a direct
connection, they necessarily exchange and expose their IP addresses to each other.
This is a core requirement of how direct peer-to-peer connections work.

However, peer-to-peer in the sense of **end-to-end encryption** is fully compatible
with IP privacy, as encryption protects the content of your communications regardless
of network topology.

If you need both end-to-end encryption and IP address privacy, you have several options:

### Option 1: Use Tor or Similar Onion Routing

Services like Tor provide onion routing, which encrypts packet metadata for each
relay in the route. This offers strong IP privacy guarantees through multi-hop
routing with layered encryption.

### Option 2: Relay-Only Mode (Upcoming)

Upcoming releases of iroh will support disabling hole-punching to send all traffic
exclusively through relays. This provides IP privacy with some important caveats:

- **Single-hop routing**: Traffic passes through one relay, not multiple hops
- **Trust required**: The relay operator can technically see which endpoints are
  communicating and their IP addresses
- **Data remains encrypted**: The relay cannot read the actual content due to
  end-to-end encryption

This mode is suitable when you trust your relay infrastructure but still want to
avoid direct IP exposure between endpoints.

### Future: Multi-Hop Relay Routing

We've explored the possibility of adding multi-hop relay routing to iroh. While
technically feasible, this feature is not currently on the near-term roadmap.

It's important to note that even with multi-hop relay routing, this would not be
equivalent to onion routing. True onion routing requires encrypting packet metadata
for each relay in the route, which would require significant protocol changes.
