title: "Dedicated Infrastructure"
---

By default, iroh will use public shared infrastructure to facilitate connections over
DNS and end-to-end encryption over relays. This infrastructure comprises:

1. [Relays](/concepts/relays)
2. [Discovery Servers (DNS)](/concepts/discovery)

Relays forward traffic when direct peer-to-peer connections are not possible as well
as facilitates holepunching for direct connections. These servers are managed and
maintained by the [n0 team](https://n0.computer), and are shared by a global public network of
developers.

We recommend using the public relays for development and testing, as they are
free to use and require no setup. However, for production systems, we recommend
using dedicated relays instead.

## Why use dedicated relays in production?

Using a dedicated relays can provide several benefits, including improved performance,
enhanced security, better uptime guarantees, and greater control over your network infrastructure. By
using your own servers, you can optimize connection speeds and reduce
latency for your specific use case. 

If you require more control over your relay infrastructure, you can choose to
[self-host your own
relay](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/tree/main/iroh-relay) or [upgrade to
a managed relay service](https://n0des.iroh.computer). This managed relay
service is monitored by the number zero team who maintain the iroh project, and
offers SLAs around uptime and performance.
