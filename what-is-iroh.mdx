title: "What is iroh?"
---

iroh is a modular networking stack written in Rust. It provides
the building blocks to create applications that can communicate
using fast, cheap, and reliable connections.

## Core features
- **Direct**: iroh enables direct connections between
  devices, allowing them to communicate without relying on centralized servers.
  It uses relay servers as a fallback when direct connections are not possible.
- **Secure**: All connections established through iroh are
  authenticated and encrypted end-to-end using the QUIC protocol, ensuring data
  privacy and integrity.
- **Modular**: iroh is built around a system of composable protocols
  that can be mixed and matched to suit the needs of different applications. This
  allows developers to easily add functionality such as file sharing, messaging,
  and real-time collaboration.

## Use cases
- **Local-first, offline-first applications**: iroh provides the networking foundation for
  building applications that can operate without 100% reliance on servers.
- **File sharing**: With protocols like iroh-blobs, iroh enables efficient
  file sharing.
- **Structured data**: iroh's support for flexible data protocols allows
developers to build applications that support real-time collaborative editing
and data synchronization. Any kind of CRDT or OT sync protocol can be integrated.

## Getting started
To get started with iroh, check out the [quickstart guide](/quickstart) or explore the
[protocols documentation](/protocols) to see what protocols are available and
how to use them in your applications.
