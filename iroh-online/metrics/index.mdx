When you add endpoints to your network, various metrics are collected to help improve
performance and user experience. These metrics include:

By monitoring these metrics, you can identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement in your application.

All endpoints added to your network can have these metrics collected and reported to the Iroh Online project dashboard.

## Project metrics 

All endpoint metrics are aggregated at the project level, to provide insights
into overall network performance. This aggregated data helps in understanding
trends and patterns without exposing individual endpoint details.  

You can also define and collect custom metrics specific to your application's needs.
This allows you to monitor application-specific events and performance
indicators.

## Endpoint metrics

On the pro plan or a self-hosted Iroh Online instance, more detailed metrics are
available for each endpoint added to the network. These metrics are available at
the endpoint level, so you can drill down into specific behaviors to better
understand performance issues. Projects that have been upgraded to
Pro or Enterprise plan have access to endpoint-level
metrics retention and lookback.

## Privacy

All metrics collected are anonymized and aggregated to ensure user privacy.
No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected or stored. The
focus is on overall network performance rather than individual user behavior.

If you have concerns about data collection, please refer to the
[privacy policy](/iroh-online/legal/privacy).
