List of all available metrics. Below is a reference grouping of every metric exposed by the frontend metrics registry, organized by level:

## Project-level metrics

These metrics are aggregated at the project level (overall project view / dashboard).

| Metric (group.metric) | Short description | Units |
|---|---|---:|
| direct_data_rate | Measured traffic that doesn't pass through a relay, as a percentage of total traffic | Percentage |
| direct_connection_rate | Measured connections that become direct at least once during the lifetime of the connection | Percentage |
| blobs.egress | Blobs egress | Bytes |
| blobs.ingress | Blobs ingress | Bytes |
| connections.active | Active connections through relay servers | Count |
| latency.p50 | 50th percentile latency between endpoints | Milliseconds |
| latency.p90 | 90th percentile latency between endpoints | Milliseconds |
| latency.p99 | 99th percentile latency between endpoints | Milliseconds |

## Relay-level metrics

Metrics in this section relate to relays and relay servers (visibility about relay processes/servers).

| Metric (group.metric) | Short description | Units |

## Endpoint-level metrics

These metrics are collected at the endpoint/node level to give per-endpoint visibility.

| Metric (group.metric) | Short description | Units |

| recv_data_ipv4 | Measured data received directly by nodes through IPv4 | Bytes |
| recv_data_ipv6 | Measured data received directly by nodes through IPv6 | Bytes |
| recv_data_relay | Measured data received by nodes through relay (IPv4 or IPv6) | Bytes |
| send_data | Measured data sent from nodes in the network | Bytes |
| send_ipv4 | Amount of data sent directly via IPv4 | Bytes |
| send_ipv6 | Amount of data sent directly via IPv6 | Bytes |
| send_relay | Amount of data sent through relay (measured by nodes sending data) | Bytes |
| send_data_network_down | Data send events when network down | Bytes |
| nodes_contacted_directly | Number of nodes contacted directly | Count |
| nodes_contacted | Number of nodes contacted (any) | Count |
