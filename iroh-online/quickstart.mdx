This guide will walk you through setting up your first Iroh Online-enabled application.

## Prerequisites

- An Iroh Online account. [Sign up for Iroh Online](/iroh-online)
- Rust installed on your machine

## Step 1: Create a Project

After signing in to Iroh Online, create a new project. This will be your control center for managing relays, metrics, and endpoints.

## Step 2: Get Your API Key

Navigate to your project's API Keys tab and create a new API key. You'll need this to authenticate your endpoints.

## Step 3: Add the Iroh Online Client

Add the `iroh-n0des` crate to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
iroh = "0.35"
iroh-n0des = "0.1"
```

## Step 4: Connect Your Endpoint

```rust
use iroh::Endpoint;
use iroh_n0des::Client;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    // Create an iroh endpoint
    let endpoint = Endpoint::builder().bind().await?;
    
    // Wait for the endpoint to be online
    endpoint.online().await;
    
    // Create the Iroh Online client with your API key
    let client = Client::new(&endpoint, "YOUR_API_KEY").await?;
    
    // Your endpoint is now reporting metrics to Iroh Online!
    
    Ok(())
}
```

- [Metrics](/iroh-online/metrics): Understand the metrics collected by Iroh Online
- [Relays](/iroh-online/relays): Set up dedicated relay servers for your network
